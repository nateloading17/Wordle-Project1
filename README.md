# Project 1 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Nathaniel Baez**

**Wordle** is an app that ... randomly selects a five letter word which the user has 5 tries to guess correctly. It denotes which letters are in the correct spaces and which letters exist in the random word to enhance the user's gaming experience. It also denotes which letters are not in the random word. 

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total
